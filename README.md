### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a front-end developer with experience in UI/UX design for both web and mobile. I am proficient in designing, wireframing, and prototyping to developing using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and currently pursuing React and TypeScript to add to my skills. I am passionate about creating user-friendly websites and web applications that are easy to use. I have a keen eye for detail and I am always willing to learn new skills and technologies.
